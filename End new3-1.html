    <h6>You’ll notice that the dash replicates much of the work of a colon or semicolon. It’s 
	   more informal than either a colon or semicolon, but if you overuse it your writing 
	   can go downhill fast: Soon your work looks like one big interruption. Avoid the 
	   dash when writing scholarly work; it’s too informal.&nbsp;</h6>
  <h6>Remember: Within grammar’s sacred bounds, punctuation is often a matter of 
	   personal preference. You might develop a love for semicolons. Or you might begin 
	   to rely heavily on commas or dashes—it just depends on how you speak naturally 
	   and how much of your natural cadence you want to portray in your writing.</h6>
	 <h6>&nbsp;An added note about exclamation marks: Avoid them. When I was very young 
	   I once sent a famous designer an excited thank you note, which he returned to me 
	   with all the exclamation marks encircled in red. A cruel response, but effective.</h6>
